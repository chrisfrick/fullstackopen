    participant browser
    participant server
    
    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    activate server
    
    Note right of browser: Browser (via JavaScript, NOT via traditional form submit) sends new note in JSON format containing content and date.
    
    server-->>browser: HTTP status code 201 (Created).
    deactivate server
    
    Note right of browser: No redirect is required. Instead the broswer appends the new note to notes list and rerenders the notes list on the page.
    
    
```
