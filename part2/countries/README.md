# Countries App
This is a React app that allows the user to search for a country. Countries are supplied via the [RESTCountries API](https://restcountries.com/)

Once a single country has been selected, info about that country is displayed, including the current weather in the capital city, fetched via the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
